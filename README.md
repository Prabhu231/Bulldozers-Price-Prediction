# Bulldozers-Price-Prediction
The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the sale price of bulldozers based on historical data.

## Steps
### Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning the data by handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
Feature engineering to create new features from existing ones (e.g., extracting year and month from sale date).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Exploring relationships between different features and the target variable (sale price).
Visualizing distributions, correlations, and identifying patterns in the data.

### Feature Selection:

Selecting the most relevant features that have the strongest correlation with the target variable or contribute significantly to the model's performance.

### Model Selection and Training:

Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression tasks. Common choices include Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Neural Networks.
Splitting the data into training and validation sets for model evaluation.

### Model Evaluation:

Evaluating models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error).
Fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search. 
RMSLE is the main metric used to evaluate the model.
